# Hi there 👋

I'm Dan from Spain, and I develop mobile and web apps for humans. I really enjoy the whole process of every new app, from the beginning until the deployment, and further. I strongly believe writing code is a state of art and every day is a new oppotunity to learn and be a better developer.
