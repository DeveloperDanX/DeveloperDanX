# Hi there 👋

I'm Dan from Spain, and I develop mobile and web apps for humans. I really enjoy the whole process of every new app, from the beginning until the deployment, and further. I strongly believe writing code is a state of art and every day is a new oppotunity to learn and be a better developer.

## Skills and Experience
* ⚛️ React
* 📱 React Native
* 💻 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript

## Currently Learning
* ⌨️ SwiftUI ('React Native on Steroids')
